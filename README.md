June 2019, Python version of a famous Italian card game. 

## Purpose and outline 
The following is a simple combination of Jupyter Notebook adn pdf version of a code I made around 2 years ago, just after the end of my basic course in programming with pyhton and algorithms. It was my first individual projects, not a university or job related task, just for the sake of fun and interest in understanding some of the capabilities of a beautiful programming language such as Python.
