    "Just after the end of my exams, being that most of my friends from Italy were busy studying since exams end most of the times one month later than my university, I came up with this idea. _Stracciacamicia_ is a famous card game, easy to understand and played by many to spend time in company. I wanted to practice some of the skills I learnt from my first exam with python (Fundamentals of Computer Science, first year), so please note that the knowledge base is less than my present level. Anyway, I decided to keep it as original as possible, in order to show what are the main concepts I acquired during the first year of programming. All the work done has been moved to this notebook to make it more easy to understand for the reader."

    "Rag shirt or scamicia is a card game popular in Italy through a deck of 40 divided into 4 suits (cups, coins, sticks, swords) of 10 cards each and played by 2 or more people, even in odd numbers. <br>\n",
    "The rules of the game are very simple, so much so that it is preferred by children who are starting to learn the use of playing cards. Each player may not use more than one hand during the game. This must be the same both when placing the card and when beating on the deck of cards when 2 identical cards are thrown in a row. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arrangement of cards**  <br>\n",
    "Once the cards have been shuffled and divided by the player on his left, they are divided into equal piles, as many as there are players. Once the turn is over, the player on your right will serve the cards.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The cards must obviously be thrown in different ways depending on the number of players. If there are 2 players they should be gently placed by turning it from the top; if there are 3 players the cards must be turned, always gently, but from the side.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Game** <br>\n",
    "Each player holds his own bundle, as he received it and without looking at its contents. The only winning cards are the ace , two and three of any suit.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The first player places the top card of their pile on the table in a visible way. The other players take turns doing the same, so as to form a common pile in the center of the table.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "When a player plays one of the three winning cards, the next player is obliged to play the indicated number of cards (1 for the ace, 2 for the two and three for the three). If during these play one of the winning cards comes up, the obligation is interrupted and it is up to the next player to play the number of cards indicated. If the player forced to play the cards does not place a winning card, the pile of cards on the table is taken by the player who played the last card. This will place the cards under yours and start a new game. In Sicily, when a card equal to the previous one is placed, it is necessary to beat the pile with the hand to grab it.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**The endless game** <br>\n",
    "There is a deck configuration that leads to an infinite game, i.e. in which players will never reach zero cards, as after a certain sequence of moves they will return to the initial state. It was found in 2017 [1] , and is the following (0 indicates a card other than ace, 2 and 3):<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Player 1: 0 0 3 0 2 0 2 0 3 0 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 0 <br>\n",

    "Player 2: 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 <br>\n",

    "This arrangement has long been unknown, so much so that it has even been classified as an unsolved problem in \"Unsolved problems in Combinatorial Games\". Small applications can also be found online that can simulate games.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Score**  <br>\n",
    "The aim of the game is to take all the cards possible until you remain the only owner. Hence the definition of leaving the other players with their shirts alone . So the score is simply given by the count of the games won.\""

I believe that at the time I designed this workflow the reason for this distinction was that first player advantage, which could be simply seen as the fact that he/she plays cards first, makes it more difficult to inglobe the two functions in one. Basically the program should always check the first before the second, and then let the second play, thus the separation of moves. "
